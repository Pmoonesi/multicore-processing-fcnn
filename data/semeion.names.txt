of Sciences of Communication, Rome, Italy (http://www.semeion.it/), for 
machine learning research.

Data Set Information:


1593 handwritten digits from around 80 persons were scanned, stretched 
in a rectangular box 16x16 in a gray scale of 256 values.Then each pixel 
of each image was scaled into a bolean (1/0) value using a fixed 
threshold.

Each person wrote on a paper all the digits from 0 to 9, twice. The 
commitment was to write the digit the first time in the normal way 
(trying to write each digit accurately) and the second time in a fast 
way (with no accuracy).

The best validation protocol for this dataset seems to be a 5x2CV, 50% 
Tune (Train +Test) and completly blind 50% Validation.

Attribute Information:

This dataset consists of 1593 records (rows) and 256 attributes 
(columns).

Each record represents a handwritten digit, orginally scanned with a 
resolution of 256 grays scale (28).

Each pixel of the each original scanned image was first stretched, and 
after scaled between 0 and 1 (setting to 0 every pixel whose value was 
under tha value 127 of the grey scale (127 included) and setting to 1 
each pixel whose orinal value in the grey scale was over 127).

Finally, each binary image was scaled again into a 16x16 square box (the 
final 256 binary attributes).
